# StreamLabsCommandToggle
A Streamlabs chatbot script that allows you to toggle between five responses for the same command.
Toggle between up to five responses for the same command without the need to edit. !command r1 or !command r2 would toggle between the two responses. The default is r1 response, and will reset to its default every time you restart/reload the bot. You can make multiple copies of the script and use it for different commands.
