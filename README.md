# StreamLabsCommandToggle
A Streamlabs chatbot script that allows you to toggle between two responses for the same command.
Toggle between two responses for the same command without the need to edit. !command on or !command off would toggle between the two responses. The default is Off response, and will reset to its default every time you restart/reload the bot. You can make multiple copies of the script and use it for different commands.
